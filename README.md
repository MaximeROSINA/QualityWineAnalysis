# Data Analysis Project

### Wine Quality Analysis

For our data analysis final project, we chose to work on the Wine Quality dataset. This dataset contains oenological objectives and sensitive data. The dataset was created in 2009 by P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis in order to “Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties.”.

The aim of this project will be to treat and analyse this dataset in order to extract and identify the main objective criteria that makes a wine taste good.
